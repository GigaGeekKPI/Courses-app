# Yeah, staying at home, right ?

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Run app -> https://gigageekkpi.github.io/Courses-app/

In the application you can view availible courses and stop procrastinating. Amaizing ! You have:

* Ability to view courses
* Ability to filter courses by name
* Ability to edit courses
* Ability to delete or create new courses.

There's no db, but let's imagine this app is useful. At least you can create your own backend and sell the product. 

Have fun :)
